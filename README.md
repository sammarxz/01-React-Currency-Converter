## Currency Converter
I decided to participate in a challenge with myself, to create 7 programming projects for the next 7 days. And this is the first, a simple dollar to real converter and vice versa in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) using the free [Api](https://ratesapi.io/) for exchange rates api with currency conversion. I also took advantage and learned a little more about [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).


### How to use
```
$ git clone git@github.com:sammarxz/01-React-Currency-Converter.git
$ cd 01-React-Currency-Converter
$ npm install
$ yarn start
```
